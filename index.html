    <p>What started out as a childhood fantasy is well on it's way to becoming a reality. Some video game ideas have been added to the idea note book by one of our employees. We also have some books in the making.  Once we become an official buisness they will become available for sale in stores like GameStop and Barnes and Noble. Head of Animation, Taufiq Abdus, and CEO and Founder, Jwann Layton, met in highschool and after many debates they settled on a name for the company. And thus Shadow Storm Entertainment was born.</p>
