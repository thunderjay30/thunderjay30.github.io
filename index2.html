    <h4>Origin Story</h4>
    <p>A Brooklynite, born and raised in Canarsie. As a child I wanted to follow in my father's foot steps and become a police officer. As I grew my body began to disagree with this dream (eating habits really), and once I entered my teen years I went into gaming. With no idea what I wanted to do when I grew up I began writing short stories, and thus Thunder Jay was born! Fighting crime with methods close to Daredevil and Batman, the wit of Spider Man or Hal Jordan, and powers like those of Zues, Thunder Jay was cold yet fair.</p>
